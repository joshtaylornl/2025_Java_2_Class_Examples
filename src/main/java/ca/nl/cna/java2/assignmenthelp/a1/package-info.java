/**
 * Java Review Assignment
 *
 * You will create 3 classes as part of our banking application, as well as what I will call a “driver” class –
 * which will test out the functionality. The banking application classes will be structured as follows:
 *
 * BankAccount (which will act as the superclass)
 * ChequingAccount (a subclass of BankAccount)
 * SavingsAccount (also a subclass of BankAccount)
